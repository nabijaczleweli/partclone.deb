partclone for Debian
--------------------

The source has been retrieved from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/partclone/files/testing/partclone_0.2.22.tar.gz/download,
and the upstream's debian subdirectory has been removed to make the debian
orig.tar.gz archive

Modifications are managed by quilt, see /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source
