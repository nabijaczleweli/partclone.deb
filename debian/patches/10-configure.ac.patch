Description: Upstream changes introduced in version 0.2.22-1
 This patch has been created by dpkg-source during the package build.
 Here's the last changelog entry, hopefully it gives details on why
 those changes were made:
 .
 partclone (0.2.22-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Initial release (Closes: #623452)
   * removed the upstream's debian subdirectory, and taken some of its contents
     as an input for the new debian subdirectory generated by dh_make
   * refreshed the list of build-dependencies which had been defined by
     upstream developers: many filesystem libraries have been merged into
     libc6, and are part of the current kernels
 .
